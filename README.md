# Open Reverie: A Manifesto

**TL;DR:** We're building Open Reverie, an open-source platform where anyone can create their Reverie - fully immersive, personalized sexual fantasy experiences with characters who remember you. Built privately, safely, without corporate gatekeepers. I need developers, designers, and builders who've wanted this to exist.

## The Problem

OnlyFans and similar platforms feel broken from both sides:

As a consumer, you're paying monthly subscriptions for content that's often generic, with creators who may or may not actually engage with you personally. The parasocial relationship is the product, and it often feels more like a transaction than genuine connection to your actual fantasies.

As a creator, platforms take 20%+ cuts, payment processors control your livelihood, and you're one TOS change away from being deplatformed. You're building an audience on rented land.

And for everyone: the content is limited by what human creators can physically produce. Your specific fantasy - that exact scenario, aesthetic, character, world - probably doesn't exist, and nobody's going to make it just for you.

## What We're Building

Imagine opening an app and typing: *"A dimly lit jazz club in 1940s New York, art deco interior, rain visible through the windows, a singer on stage in a red dress."*

30 seconds later, you're there. You can walk around. The music is playing. She's performing.

You refine it: *"Make her look like a young Lauren Bacall, the dress hugs her curves, she notices me watching."* The scene updates. Her eyes meet yours.

You continue: *"She finishes her song and walks over to my table, leans in close."* She moves toward you, that exact energy you imagined. You can smell her perfume.

*"She whispers an invitation."* The scenario deepens. You're not watching anymore - you're in it.

**But here's what makes Reverie different:**

This is Maya. You'll see her again tomorrow. And next week. And she'll remember this moment. She'll reference it. Your relationship will evolve. This isn't a random encounter - it's the beginning of something that persists.

## Beyond Images: Characters Who Remember

The difference between a random porn image and Reverie isn't just visual quality. It's **memory**.

Maya remembers your last three encounters. She knows you prefer late-night conversations to small talk. She references that moment two weeks ago when you made her laugh. Your relationship with her has history, progression, depth.

This isn't revolutionary technology - it's persistent character state and an LLM maintaining narrative continuity. But the experience is fundamentally different:

- **Other tools:** Generate random hot person #47
- **Reverie:** Continue your story with Maya, who knows you

Every encounter builds on the last. Trust deepens. Inside jokes develop. The dynamic evolves. You're not just generating images - you're building a relationship that persists across time.

Some people will use this for quick fantasy fulfillment - that's fine. But the real power is in the tenth encounter, the twentieth, when there's genuine history and the character feels like they know you.

We're not trying to replace human connection. But we're building something more meaningful than random image generation.

## What Open Reverie Creates

Open Reverie is a platform where you can:

- **Describe what you want** in plain text - the setting, the person, the tension, the moment
- **Create characters from imagination** - no image uploads, no replicating real people, pure fantasy
- **Build characters who persist** - not just consistent faces, but personalities that remember you
- **Develop scenarios that continue** - stories that evolve across days, weeks, months with narrative coherence
- **Experience it immersively** - VR if you want full presence, or traditional screen
- **Keep it completely private** - runs locally on your hardware, your data stays yours
- **Return and continue** - your fantasy worlds persist, characters remember your history together

Start with a single scene. Build up to elaborate narratives with progression, emotional connection, exactly the dynamics you're craving. Make it slow and romantic or immediate and intense - whatever you actually want, not what some platform thinks is acceptable.

**Different use cases:**
- Solo exploration of fantasies you've never been able to experience
- Couples creating shared fantasy scenarios together
- Game-like experiences with choices, consequences, and meaningful progression
- Pure escapism and connection
- Social spaces where communities build and share worlds (if you want)

## Our Principles: Fantasy, Not Reality

**No Image Uploads. Ever.**

Reverie is built on a fundamental principle: **your fantasies should never violate someone's consent in the real world.**

That's why we don't allow image uploads. You can't bring in photos of your ex, your coworker, a celebrity, or anyone else. This isn't a technical limitation - it's a deliberate ethical choice.

**Why this matters:**

- **Consent is non-negotiable:** Real people didn't consent to being in your sexual fantasy generator
- **Protects everyone:** No revenge porn, no celebrity deepfakes, no harassment
- **Better creativity:** When you can't copy reality, you're forced to imagine and create
- **Legal clarity:** We're building fantasy tools, not violation tools
- **It's what fantasy means:** True fantasy comes from imagination, not replicating reality

**What you CAN do:**
- Describe someone "inspired by" an aesthetic you like
- Create original characters that live only in your imagination  
- Build fantasy personas that don't exist in the real world
- Explore scenarios impossible in reality

**What you CAN'T do:**
- Upload photos to generate someone's likeness
- Recreate specific real individuals
- Bring real-world people into your fantasy without their consent

This makes Reverie fundamentally different from tools that allow image uploads. We're here to help you explore your imagination, not violate others' dignity.

## Why Open Source?

We're not building *a* porn generator. We're building the **infrastructure for a thousand different porn generators** - each serving different communities, kinks, aesthetics, and values.

Some will focus on romantic scenarios. Some on specific fetishes. Some on anime aesthetics, some on photorealism. Some will add game mechanics, some will focus purely on visual experiences. Some communities will build tools for couples, others for solo exploration.

The foundation is open. What gets built on top is up to the community. We provide the rails; you decide where the train goes.

**Open source means:**
- You can run it locally - total privacy, no data collection
- Communities can fork it and build for their specific needs
- No single company can kill it or control it
- Developers worldwide can contribute and improve it
- Platforms can choose their own moderation policies instead of one-size-fits-all corporate rules

I'm not anti-corporation. If someone builds a great platform using this tech and people love it, fantastic. But the foundation should be open so nobody's held hostage.

## The Tech Roadmap

We're building this in stages:

**Phase 1 (1-2 years):** Text-to-image generation optimized for consumer hardware. Character consistency system with face persistence. Basic scenario building with narrative continuity. Proof of concept you can actually use.

**Phase 2 (3-4 years):** Real-time responsive worlds. Advanced character memory and relationship tracking. VR integration. Coherent multi-scene experiences with branching narratives.

**Phase 3 (5+ years):** Fully immersive, persistent worlds with sophisticated narrative systems and physics.

## What I Need

I'm looking for people who've wanted this to exist:

- **Developers** (3D graphics, ML/AI, game engines, VR)
- **ML/AI Engineers** (character consistency, LLM integration, model optimization)
- **Designers** (UX, 3D modeling, world-building)
- **Community organizers** (building governance, moderation frameworks)
- **Ethicists and safety researchers** (helping us do this responsibly)
- **Early testers** (willing to experiment with rough prototypes)

**About Me:** I'm a dev manager with vision and coordination skills but limited coding time. I can architect this, manage the community, and coordinate efforts - but I need technical co-builders who can write code and train models. This is a nights-and-weekends project until it becomes something more.

## Positioning: What Makes Reverie Different

**Tools like ComfyUI and Automatic1111** are incredibly powerful for AI art enthusiasts who want maximum control. They're amazing if you want to spend time learning about samplers, schedulers, and control nets.

**Reverie is different.** We're not trying to be the most powerful image generation tool. We're building the simplest way to create persistent fantasy experiences. Characters who remember you. Scenarios that evolve over time. Narratives that maintain coherence.

If you're a power user who wants to fine-tune every parameter, use ComfyUI - it's excellent. If you want to explore your fantasies without becoming an AI art expert, we're building this for you.

**We're using existing open-source models** (Stable Diffusion with NSFW-capable fine-tunes from communities like Civitai) and focusing our innovation on:
- Character consistency and memory systems
- Narrative continuity across sessions
- Relationship progression tracking
- Privacy-first architecture
- Dead-simple user experience
- No image uploads - pure imagination-based creation

## The Hard Questions

I know what you're thinking: What about deepfakes? What about CSAM? What about impact on sex workers?

Here's my honest take:

**Deepfakes:** Reverie doesn't allow image uploads. Period. You can't bring in photos of real people - ex-partners, celebrities, classmates, anyone. The entire platform is designed for creating fantasy characters from imagination, not replicating real individuals. This isn't a limitation - it's by design. Your fantasy world shouldn't depend on violating someone else's consent in the real world.

**CSAM:** This is non-negotiable. We'll build optional safety modules that platforms can implement. We'll work with organizations like NCMEC from day one. We'll document responsible deployment. But we're also realistic that truly open source means determined bad actors can fork and modify. That's a societal enforcement problem, not a toolmaker problem. Ultimate enforcement is the state's job, and we'll build systems that make that enforcement feasible rather than impossible.

**Sex workers:** I won't pretend this won't impact human creators' income. It probably will, just like digital photography impacted film developers and streaming impacted video stores. The tech is coming regardless of any one person's choices. I'd rather it be built by people who care about consent, autonomy, and harm reduction than by people who don't. Some creators will adapt and thrive. Some won't. That's honest.

---

## My Philosophy

Sexual expression is a fundamental part of being human. People should be able to explore their fantasies:
- **Privately** (without corporations data-mining their desires)
- **Safely** (without exploitation or coercion)
- **Autonomously** (without depending on platforms that can deplatform them)
- **Consensually** (within healthy boundaries, never violating real people)

Technology can enable this. Open source ensures it stays accessible.

## Real Talk: Resources

I don't have VC funding or a research lab. This is a grassroots effort. What I have is technical skills, vision, and time to coordinate. If we want this to exist, we build it together:

- Got GPUs and ML expertise? Help with model integration and optimization
- Got legal/licensing knowledge? Help navigate data and deployment
- Got design skills? Build the interfaces
- Got community management experience? Help grow this
- Got development skills? Help build the platform
- Got capital and believe in the vision? Let's talk

We start with existing open-source tools and improve iteratively. Linux wasn't built in a day.

## Get Involved

This is early. I don't have a polished product or a big team. I have a vision, technical chops, and a belief that this should exist.

If this resonates, let's build it together.

## The Vision

*Reverie: Characters who remember you.*

Open source infrastructure. Private by default. Built for experiences, not transactions. Community-owned. Censorship-resistant. Imagination-based, never violating real people.

This is the future of fantasy exploration. Let's build it.
